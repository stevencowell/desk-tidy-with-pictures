        <p>Safety in a workshop isnâ€™t just a classroom rule â€“ itâ€™s a professional requirement known as Work Health and Safety (WHS). Professionals follow strict safety protocols. Loud machinery may require ear protection and fine wood dust often means wearing a mask or using special ventilation. Around 2,000 U.S. workers suffer an eye injury each day, and most could be prevented with proper protection. This shows why wearing safety goggles is so important. In advanced workshops you may also see safety signs reminding everyone to wear PPE and be cautious.</p>  
        <p>Case Study: In one woodworking shop, a craftsman skipped wearing safety glasses for a quick cut. A small piece of wood flew up and permanently injured his eye. Since then, that shop enforces a rule that no one cuts anything without eyewear, even for a second.</p>
