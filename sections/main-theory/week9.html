  <summary><b>Week 9: Finishing and Evaluating</b></summary>
  <article>
    <h4>Final Finishes</h4>
    <p>With all parts assembled, we sand the entire desk tidy and apply a protective finish such as clear varnish or furniture wax. Light sanding between coats keeps the surface smooth.</p>  
    <h4>Evaluating Your Work</h4>
    <p>Check that joints line up neatly, the desk tidy stands without wobbling, and the surfaces feel even. Decide whether the design keeps your supplies organised and note any improvements for next time.</p>  
    <p>Write a short evaluation describing what worked well and what you would change if you built it again.</p>

    <legend><b>Week 9 Quiz</b></legend>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> After applying the first coat of varnish, a student notices the surface feels rough. She decides to apply the next coat immediately. The finish looks uneven. What should she have done between coats?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_1" type="radio" value="More varnish"/> A. Apply extra varnish to cover the roughness.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_1" type="radio" value="Sand between coats"/> B. Lightly sand the surface between coats and wipe off dust before applying the next coat.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_1" type="radio" value="Add water"/> C. Add water to the varnish to thin it out.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_1" type="radio" value="One coat only"/> D. Leave the first coat as the final coat; no sanding required.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> When evaluating his desk tidy, a student notices it wobbles on the desk. He ignores the wobble because the joints look neat. Why is checking stability important?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_2" type="radio" value="Stability unimportant"/> A. Stability is only important for furniture you sit on.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_2" type="radio" value="Check wobble"/> B. A wobbly tidy could tip over; he should check for level and adjust or sand the base so it sits flat.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_2" type="radio" value="Feature wobble"/> C. Wobbling adds character, so leave it as a feature.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_2" type="radio" value="Only decorative"/> D. Stability doesn’t matter if the tidy is decorative only.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> Sarah writes in her evaluation: “It’s perfect.” What is missing from her evaluation?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_3" type="radio" value="No evaluation"/> A. She shouldn’t evaluate her own work; only the teacher should.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_3" type="radio" value="Positives and improvements"/> B. She should include both what worked well and what she would change next time.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_3" type="radio" value="Classmates names"/> C. She should include the names of her classmates who helped.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_3" type="radio" value="Cost materials"/> D. She should list the cost of the materials used.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> James only comments on the shape of his tidy in his evaluation. What other aspect should he consider?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_4" type="radio" value="Functionality"/> A. Whether the tidy holds his stationery and keeps it organised.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_4" type="radio" value="Colour match"/> B. Whether it matches his favourite colour.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_4" type="radio" value="Enjoyment only"/> C. Whether he enjoyed the process more than others.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_4" type="radio" value="Sales potential"/> D. Whether he could sell it for a high price.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> A student finishes his tidy with furniture wax. He applies the wax and leaves it. The surface looks dull. What finishing step did he miss?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_5" type="radio" value="Heat wax"/> A. Heat the wax with a hair dryer to shine it.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_5" type="radio" value="Buff wax"/> B. Buff the wax with a soft cloth after it dries to create a smooth sheen.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_5" type="radio" value="Paint over wax"/> C. Add a layer of paint over the wax for gloss.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_5" type="radio" value="Nothing needed"/> D. He didn’t miss any step; wax is always dull.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> A student evaluates his project before the varnish has cured. He writes that the surface is sticky and the colour uneven. Why should he wait for the finish to cure before evaluating?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_6" type="radio" value="Early evaluation helps"/> A. Evaluating while it’s sticky helps find faults early.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_6" type="radio" value="Wait curing"/> B. The final texture and colour appear only after the finish cures; evaluating too early gives misleading results.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_6" type="radio" value="Dust stick"/> C. Waiting longer will attract dust; evaluating early prevents that.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_6" type="radio" value="Finish irrelevant"/> D. The finish doesn’t affect evaluation; only structure matters.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> Another student writes only about problems and criticisms in his evaluation, pointing out every mistake. Why is it important to balance positives and negatives?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_7" type="radio" value="Negatives only"/> A. Only listing negatives shows he is honest and helps him improve.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_7" type="radio" value="Balanced evaluation"/> B. A balanced evaluation acknowledges strengths and areas to improve, helping build confidence and guide learning.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_7" type="radio" value="Exaggerate positives"/> C. Positives should be exaggerated to impress others.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_7" type="radio" value="Only for groups"/> D. Balanced evaluations are only necessary in group projects.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> Tom writes that he likes the colour he chose and enjoyed painting. He doesn’t mention whether his tidy organises his supplies. Why should functionality be part of the evaluation?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_8" type="radio" value="Marks requirement"/> A. Because the teacher requires it for marks.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_8" type="radio" value="Meets brief"/> B. The design brief is to organise supplies; he should evaluate how well the tidy holds and organises his stationery.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_8" type="radio" value="Colour important"/> C. Colour is the most important factor; function doesn’t matter.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_8" type="radio" value="Function subjective"/> D. Function is subjective, so he can ignore it.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> After gluing, a student notices squeeze-out around the joints but leaves it there. After finishing, the dried glue shows through the varnish. What should he have done before applying the finish?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_9" type="radio" value="Leave glue"/> A. Leave the glue as a decorative feature.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_9" type="radio" value="Paint over glue"/> B. Paint over the glue lumps so they blend in.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_9" type="radio" value="Remove excess glue"/> C. Carefully remove excess glue with a damp cloth or scraper before it dries so it doesn’t show through the finish.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_9" type="radio" value="Add more glue"/> D. Add more glue to strengthen the joint.</label>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><b>Scenario:</b> In his evaluation, a student concludes there is nothing he would change. The teacher suggests adding compartments and adjusting dimensions next time. Why is proposing specific improvements useful?</p>
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_10" type="radio" value="Means failure"/> A. Suggesting improvements means the student failed the project.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="true" name="main_q9_10" type="radio" value="Critical thinking"/> B. Suggesting specific improvements shows critical thinking and helps plan future projects.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_10" type="radio" value="No benefit"/> C. There is no benefit; once a project is complete it cannot be improved.</label><br />
        <label><input data-correct="false" name="main_q9_10" type="radio" value="Advanced only"/> D. Only advanced students should suggest improvements.</label>
